# Stock Market Analysis and Prediction using Python

## Overview
This project aims to analyze historical stock data and predict future stock prices using Python. It leverages the `yfinance` library for data collection and applies traditional time series forecasting methods, including ARIMA and linear regression. The goal is to support data-driven investment decisions by evaluating price changes, daily returns, moving averages, and stock correlations.

## Features
- **Historical Data Collection**: Fetches stock data using `yfinance`.
- **Data Analysis**: Computes price changes, daily returns, moving averages, and correlations.
- **Forecasting**: Implements ARIMA and linear regression models to predict future stock prices.
- **Visualization**: Provides visual representations of stock trends and forecasts.

## Installation

## Stock Market Analysis and Prediction Web App
As an add-on to this project, I also created an easy to use web app using streamlit for quick stock analysis.

### Features

- Fetch real-time stock data for any company using its ticker symbol.
- Visualize stock performance over time with **line charts**.
- Analyze stock volumes with **histograms**.
- Interactive visualizations with **Plotly** for better user experience.

### Access the Web App

You can access the live web app here: [Stock Market Analysis Web App](https://stock-market-analysis-web.streamlit.app/)

Feel free to explore the data and play around with the visualizations!
